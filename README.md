## Description

The game consists of 4 agents, red, green, blue, and grey. The green agents represent people in a democratic society, who have the choice to vote or not vote in an election. The red agent represents a political party can influence the opinion and uncertainty of the green agents. Each action by the red agent may cause them to lose the ability to interact with some green agents for the next few rounds, diminishing their influence. Higher power actions cause more follower loss for the red agent. The blue agent represents another political party that can influence the opinion and uncertainty of the green agents. Each action by the blue agent has an energy cost associated with it, the blue agent’s actions are restricted by this energy cost. The grey agents can represent politicians that the blue agent can ask to make a speech instead of making an interaction with the green agents. The grey agent will interact with the green agents and influence their opinions and uncertainties without lowering the blue agent energy level. There is a chance that the grey agent is a spy for the red agent and will influence green agents towards the red agent’s desired outcome. The blue and red agents take turns interacting with the green agents, at the end of each round the green agent’s communicate and influence each other’s uncertainties. This goes on for 20 rounds and then either red or blue wins based on the percentage of green agents who choose to vote.
